# Test Writing Guidelines

## Source of Authority

Tests are derived from specification documents (`specification/`). The specification is authoritative for all behavioral expectations, formulas, contracts, and edge cases. When writing a test, consult the relevant specification — not intuition or general expectations about how a function "should" behave.

Authority chain: `specification/*.md` → `doc/architecture/` → `doc/architecture/data-models/`

## Specifications Are Immutable

Specification documents (`specification/`) **must not be modified** when writing tests. Tests encode the specification contracts using TDD — they are derived from the spec, not the other way around.

- If a spec appears ambiguous or incorrect, file feedback in `specification/feedback/` — do not change the spec.
- If a test cannot be written to match the spec, the issue belongs in feedback, not in a spec edit.

## Numeric Bounds Must Be Formula-Derived

When a specification defines a formula, all test bounds and expected values **must be computed from that formula** — never estimated by intuition.

- **Compute the expected value** by substituting the test input into the spec formula before choosing an assertion bound.
- **Show the derivation** in a comment next to the assertion so reviewers can verify it.
- **Do not use "round number" bounds** (e.g., `< 1.01`) unless the formula confirms they hold at the chosen input.

Example — wrong:
```python
# "Should be very close to 1.0 for large freq"
assert symbol_weight(1_000_000) < 1.01  # intuition, not derived
```

Example — correct:
```python
# 1.0 + 2.0 / log2(1_000_001) ≈ 1.1003
assert symbol_weight(1_000_000) < 1.2
```

## Test File Feedback

When a test appears to conflict with its specification, file feedback in `test/feedback/<test-file-name>.md` describing the discrepancy. Do not silently adjust the test or the implementation.
