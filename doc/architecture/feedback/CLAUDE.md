# Architecture Feedback Writing Guidelines

## Authority

Architecture feedback is informed by the authority chain: data model documents (`doc/architecture/data-models/`) → architecture documents (`doc/architecture/`) → requirements and features (`doc/requirements/`, `doc/features/`). When filing feedback, verify the issue against the authoritative source before reporting it.

**Before writing feedback:** Read the relevant data model documents (`doc/architecture/data-models/expression-tree.md`, `doc/architecture/data-models/index-entities.md`) and any related architecture documents. An apparent issue may already be resolved in a higher-authority source — in that case, cite that source and recommend aligning the architecture document with it.

## Purpose

Feedback documents capture issues, ambiguities, contradictions, and gaps discovered in architecture documents during specification writing, implementation planning, or code generation. They exist to inform the architect — not to fix the architecture directly.

## File Naming

One feedback file per architecture document. Name matches the source:

```
doc/architecture/feedback/<doc-name>.md
```

Example: feedback for `doc/architecture/retrieval-pipeline.md` goes in `doc/architecture/feedback/retrieval-pipeline.md`.

## Document Structure

```markdown
# Architecture Feedback: <document title>

**Source:** [doc/architecture/<name>.md](../<name>.md)
**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD of last update>
**Reviewer:** <role or context, e.g., "Specification writer (channel-mepo spec)">

---

## Issue <N>: <Short descriptive title>

**Severity:** <high | medium | low>
**Section:** <document section number and name>

**Problem:** <What is wrong, ambiguous, or missing. State the conflict precisely — quote the document where helpful.>

**Impact:** <What breaks or diverges downstream if this is not resolved. Frame in terms of specification or implementation consequences.>

**Suggested resolution:** <Concrete recommendation. If multiple options exist, list them with trade-offs. Label your preferred option.>

---
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Source** | yes | Relative link to the architecture document this feedback targets. |
| **Date** | yes | Date of last update (absolute, YYYY-MM-DD). Update when issues are added or removed. |
| **Reviewer** | yes | Who or what produced the feedback. |
| **Severity** | yes | `high` = blocks specification or causes contradictions across multiple specs. `medium` = forces a spec writer judgment call the architecture should have made. `low` = documentation clarity or future-proofing. |
| **Section** | yes | Document section number and name where the issue originates. If it spans sections, list the primary one and mention others in the problem description. |
| **Problem** | yes | The issue. Be specific: quote the conflicting text, name the contradicting document, or describe the missing information. |
| **Impact** | yes | What happens downstream if this is not resolved. |
| **Suggested resolution** | yes | At least one concrete fix. |

## Writing Rules

- **One issue per heading.** Do not combine multiple problems into a single issue.
- **Reference cross-document conflicts explicitly.** If two architecture documents or a data model and an architecture document disagree, name both files and quote both passages.
- **Use absolute section references** (e.g., "Section 3.2, `dependencies` table"), not relative ones (e.g., "the section above").
- **No fixes in feedback files.** Feedback describes what is wrong and suggests a resolution. The architect decides.
- **Remove resolved issues.** When the architect resolves an issue, delete it from the feedback file. Do not mark it as resolved — remove it entirely.
- **Delete empty feedback files.** When all issues in a feedback file are resolved and removed, delete the file. No empty feedback files.
- **Number issues sequentially.** Renumber after deletions to keep the sequence contiguous.

## Lifecycle

1. **Created** during specification writing or implementation planning when an architecture problem is found.
2. **Read** by the architect during the next architecture revision pass.
3. **Issues removed** as the architect resolves them in the source document.
4. **File deleted** when all issues are resolved (no empty feedback files).
