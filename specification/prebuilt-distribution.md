# Prebuilt Index Distribution

Download and integrity verification of prebuilt search indexes and neural model checkpoints from GitHub Releases.

**Architecture**: [prebuilt-distribution.md](../doc/architecture/prebuilt-distribution.md), [cli.md](../doc/architecture/cli.md), [component-boundaries.md](../doc/architecture/component-boundaries.md)

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the download client for prebuilt index databases and model checkpoints: release discovery, asset download with progress reporting, integrity verification, index merging, and publish script behavior.

## 2. Scope

**In scope**: `download-index` CLI subcommand, GitHub Releases API integration, manifest parsing, SHA-256 checksum verification, atomic file placement, per-library index management, index merging, publish script behavior.

**Out of scope**: Index creation (owned by extraction), storage schema (owned by storage), neural encoder interface (owned by neural-retrieval), MCP server configuration (owned by mcp-server).

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Release | A GitHub Release tagged with the `index-v` prefix, containing index and manifest assets |
| Manifest | A JSON file (`manifest.json`) in each release containing version metadata and SHA-256 checksums |
| Data directory | The platform-specific directory for application data (`~/Library/Application Support/poule/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/poule/` on Linux) |
| Libraries directory | The host directory storing per-library indexes and the merged index (default `~/poule-libraries/`, overridable via `POULE_LIBRARIES_PATH`) |
| Per-library index | A SQLite database containing declarations from a single Coq library, named `index-{library}.db` |
| Merged index | A single SQLite database combining declarations from all 6 per-library indexes |
| Supported libraries | The fixed set of 6 libraries: `stdlib`, `mathcomp`, `stdpp`, `flocq`, `coquelicot`, `coqinterval` |

## 4. Behavioral Requirements

### 4.1 Platform Data Directory

#### get_data_dir()

- REQUIRES: Nothing.
- ENSURES: Returns the platform-specific data directory path for poule. On macOS (`sys.platform == "darwin"`): `~/Library/Application Support/poule/`. On all other platforms: `~/.local/share/poule/`. Does not create the directory.

#### get_model_dir()

- REQUIRES: Nothing.
- ENSURES: Returns `get_data_dir() / "models"`. Does not create the directory.

### 4.2 Libraries Directory

#### get_libraries_dir()

- REQUIRES: Nothing.
- ENSURES: If `POULE_LIBRARIES_PATH` environment variable is set, returns its value as a Path. Otherwise returns `Path.home() / "poule-libraries"`.

### 4.3 Release Discovery

#### find_latest_release()

- REQUIRES: Network access to the GitHub API.
- ENSURES: Returns the most recent GitHub Release whose `tag_name` starts with `index-v`. Releases are returned by the API in reverse chronological order; the first match is selected.
- On no matching release: raises an error with message `"No index release found on GitHub."`.
- On network failure: raises an error with message `"Failed to reach GitHub API: {details}"`.

The discovery endpoint is:
```
GET https://api.github.com/repos/ekirton/Poule/releases
Accept: application/vnd.github+json
```

No authentication is required (public repository). Unauthenticated rate limit: 60 requests/hour.

> **Given** the repository has releases tagged `index-v1-coq8.19` and `index-v1-coq8.20`
> **When** `find_latest_release()` is called
> **Then** returns the release with tag `index-v1-coq8.20` (most recent)

> **Given** the repository has no releases with `index-v` prefix
> **When** `find_latest_release()` is called
> **Then** raises error: `"No index release found on GitHub."`

### 4.4 Manifest

The manifest is a JSON object with the following schema:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `schema_version` | string | Yes | Index schema version |
| `coq_version` | string | Yes | Coq version used during extraction |
| `libraries` | object | Yes | Per-library metadata (see below) |
| `onnx_model_sha256` | string or null | Yes | Hex-encoded SHA-256 digest of the ONNX model, or null |
| `created_at` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp of index creation |

Each entry in `libraries` is keyed by library identifier and contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Library version |
| `sha256` | string | Hex-encoded SHA-256 digest of the per-library index file |
| `asset_name` | string | Release asset filename (e.g., `index-stdlib.db`) |
| `declarations` | integer | Number of declarations in this library's index |

### 4.5 Asset Download

#### download_file(url, dest, label)

- REQUIRES: `url` is a valid HTTPS URL. `dest` is a writable path.
- ENSURES: The file at `url` is downloaded to `{dest}.tmp`. Progress is printed to stderr during download: `Downloading {label} ... {downloaded_mb:.1f} / {total_mb:.1f} MB`. On success, returns the temporary file path. On network failure: deletes the temporary file and raises an error. On any other exception: deletes the temporary file and re-raises.

Downloads use the asset's `browser_download_url` field (direct HTTPS, no redirect handling required). Data is read in 64 KB chunks.

### 4.6 Checksum Verification

#### verify_checksum(path, expected_sha256, label)

- REQUIRES: `path` points to an existing file. `expected_sha256` is a hex-encoded SHA-256 digest string.
- ENSURES: Computes the SHA-256 digest of the file at `path`. If the digest matches `expected_sha256`, returns successfully. If the digest does not match: deletes the file at `path` and raises an error with message `"Checksum verification failed for {label}. Expected {expected}, got {actual}. File deleted."`.

> **Given** a downloaded file whose SHA-256 matches the manifest
> **When** `verify_checksum` is called
> **Then** returns successfully

> **Given** a corrupted download whose SHA-256 does not match the manifest
> **When** `verify_checksum` is called
> **Then** deletes the file and raises a checksum error

### 4.7 Atomic File Placement

After checksum verification succeeds, the temporary file is moved to the final destination via `os.replace()`. This operation is atomic on POSIX systems: the destination path always contains either the previous complete file or the new verified file.

### 4.8 Index Merging

#### merge_indexes(sources, dest)

- REQUIRES: `sources` is a non-empty list of `(library_name, path)` tuples where each path points to a valid per-library SQLite index database. All source databases must share the same `schema_version` and `coq_version` in their `index_meta` tables. `dest` is a writable path. If `dest` exists, it is deleted before merge begins.
- ENSURES: Creates a new SQLite database at `dest` containing:
  - All declarations from all source databases with new auto-assigned IDs
  - All within-library dependency edges with source and destination IDs remapped via per-source old-to-new ID maps. Edges where either endpoint's ID is missing from the per-source map are silently dropped.
  - Cross-library dependency edges generated by resolving each declaration's `symbol_set` entries against the global name-to-ID map using multi-strategy resolution (exact match, `Coq.` prefix, suffix match). Self-references and duplicates (by primary key) are skipped. Ambiguous suffix matches are skipped.
  - All WL histogram vectors with remapped declaration IDs
  - A rebuilt FTS5 index covering all merged declarations
  - Recomputed symbol frequencies across the merged set
  - `index_meta` entries: `schema_version` and `coq_version` from sources, `libraries` as JSON array of library identifiers, `library_versions` as JSON object mapping identifier to version, `created_at` as current ISO 8601 timestamp
- Returns a dict with keys: `total_declarations` (int), `total_dependencies` (int), `dropped_dependencies` (int), `libraries` (list of str).

> **Given** all 6 per-library index databases
> **When** `merge_indexes` is called with all 6
> **Then** `dest` contains all declarations from all 6 libraries, and cross-library dependency edges are resolved

> **Given** `index-mathcomp.db` has dependency edges referencing stdlib declarations
> **When** merged with `index-stdlib.db` and all other libraries
> **Then** those dependency edges are resolved by name to the merged stdlib declaration IDs

> **Given** a declaration in `index-coquelicot.db` has `symbol_set` containing `"Corelib.Init.Datatypes.nat"` and `index-stdlib.db` contains declaration `Coq.Init.Datatypes.nat`
> **When** `merge_indexes` is called
> **Then** a cross-library dependency edge `(coquelicot_decl, stdlib_nat, "uses")` is created via `Coq.` prefix resolution

> **Given** two source databases with different `schema_version` values
> **When** `merge_indexes` is called
> **Then** raises error: `"Schema version mismatch: {v1} vs {v2}"`

### 4.9 download-index CLI Subcommand

```
poule download-index [--output <path>] [--libraries-dir <path>] [--include-model] [--model-dir <path>] [--force]
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--output` | path | `libraries_dir / index.db` | Where to save the merged database file |
| `--libraries-dir` | path | `get_libraries_dir()` | Libraries directory for per-library indexes |
| `--include-model` | flag | false | Also download the ONNX neural premise selection model |
| `--model-dir` | path | `get_model_dir()` | Where to save the ONNX model |
| `--force` | flag | false | Overwrite existing files without prompting |

#### Behavior

1. Call `find_latest_release()` to resolve the latest index release.
2. Download `manifest.json` from the release (in memory).
3. For each of the 6 supported libraries:
   a. Check if `index-{library}.db` exists in `libraries_dir` with checksum matching the manifest → skip if up to date.
   b. Otherwise: download, verify checksum, atomic rename to `libraries_dir / index-{library}.db`.
4. If any library was downloaded or `index.db` does not exist in `libraries_dir`:
   a. Run `merge_indexes` to produce `libraries_dir / index.db`.
5. If `--include-model` and `onnx_model_sha256` is not null: download ONNX model.
6. Print summary.

## 5. Publish Script

The publish script (`scripts/publish-release.sh`) is a shell script for the project maintainer.

### Signature

```
./scripts/publish-release.sh index-stdlib.db index-mathcomp.db ... [--model <MODEL_PATH>] [--replace]
```

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gh` | GitHub CLI, authenticated (`gh auth status`) |
| `sqlite3` | Read version metadata from `index_meta` table |
| `shasum` | Compute SHA-256 checksums |

### Behavior

1. Validate prerequisites (all tools present, `gh` authenticated, files exist).
2. For each per-library DB: read `schema_version`, `coq_version`, `library`, `library_version`, and `declarations` from `index_meta`. Verify all databases share the same `schema_version` and `coq_version`.
3. Compute SHA-256 checksums of all assets.
4. Generate `manifest.json` with per-library entries. Each library entry contains `version` (from `library_version`), `sha256`, `asset_name` (`index-{library}.db`), and `declarations` (from `declarations` metadata key).
5. Construct release tag: `index-v{schema_version}-coq{coq_version}`.
6. If tag already exists and `--replace` is not set: abort with error. If `--replace` is set: delete the existing release via `gh release delete <tag> --yes`, delete the tag via `git push origin :refs/tags/<tag>`, then continue to step 7.
7. Create GitHub Release via `gh release create` with all per-library assets + manifest + optional model.

## 9. Language-Specific Notes (Python)

- Use `click.command` for the `download-index` subcommand, registered on the existing `cli` Click group in `poule.cli.commands`.
- Use `urllib.request.urlopen` for HTTP requests (no external HTTP library).
- Use `hashlib.sha256` for checksum computation.
- Use `os.replace` for atomic file rename (POSIX atomic, Windows replaces atomically if same volume).
- Use `click.echo(..., err=True)` for all progress and status output.
- Merge module location: `src/poule/cli/merge.py` or `src/poule/storage/merge.py`.
- Package location: download client in `src/poule/cli/download.py`, path helpers in `src/poule/paths.py`.
