# Index Entities

Canonical definitions for all persistent entities in the SQLite search index. These entities are written by Coq Library Extraction, stored by the Storage component, read by the Retrieval Pipeline, and checked by the MCP Server on startup.

**Architecture docs**: [storage.md](../storage.md), [coq-extraction.md](../coq-extraction.md), [retrieval-pipeline.md](../retrieval-pipeline.md)

## declarations

The core indexing unit representing one Coq/Rocq declaration extracted from a compiled library.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | identifier | Primary key; auto-assigned |
| `name` | qualified name | Unique; required; must be fully qualified canonical form |
| `module` | qualified name | Required; must be a valid module path (e.g., `Coq.Arith.PeanoNat`) |
| `kind` | enumeration | Required; one of: `lemma`, `theorem`, `definition`, `instance`, `inductive`, `constructor`, `axiom` |
| `statement` | text | Required; pretty-printed for display and full-text search |
| `type_expr` | text | Required; pretty-printed type signature |
| `constr_tree` | serialized tree | Optional; CSE-normalized expression tree (see [expression-tree.md](expression-tree.md)); null when extraction is unsupported for this kind |
| `node_count` | positive integer | Required; must be > 0; determines which ranking metrics apply (TED threshold at 50) |
| `symbol_set` | list of qualified names | Required; JSON-encoded; each entry must be a fully qualified constant, inductive, or constructor name |

### Relationships

- **Owns** many `dependencies` as source (1:*). Deleting a declaration cascades to its dependency edges.
- **Owns** many `dependencies` as destination (1:*). Deleting a declaration cascades to referencing edges.
- **Owns** many `wl_vectors`, one per h value (1:3). Deleting a declaration cascades to its vectors.
- **Referenced by** `declarations_fts` via content sync (1:1).
- **References** `symbol_freq` via `symbol_set` entries (many-to-many, implicit through JSON array).

## dependencies

A directed edge capturing a structural relationship between two declarations.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `src` | reference to declaration | Required; must reference an existing declaration |
| `dst` | reference to declaration | Required; must reference an existing declaration; must differ from `src` (no self-loops) |
| `relation` | enumeration | Required; one of: `uses` (src directly references dst), `instance_of` (src is a typeclass instance of dst) |

**Composite key**: (`src`, `dst`, `relation`). Multiple relation types may exist between the same pair.

### Relationships

- **Belongs to** one declaration as source (*:1, owned by `declarations`).
- **References** one declaration as destination (*:1).

## wl_vectors

A precomputed Weisfeiler-Lehman histogram vector for one declaration at one iteration depth, used for structural screening.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `decl_id` | reference to declaration | Required; must reference an existing declaration |
| `h` | bounded integer | Required; must be one of {1, 3, 5}; h=3 is the primary query depth |
| `histogram` | map of label to count | Required; JSON-encoded; all values must be non-negative integers; sparse (only labels with count > 0) |

**Composite key**: (`decl_id`, `h`). One vector per declaration per h value.

### Relationships

- **Belongs to** one declaration (*:1, owned by `declarations`; three vectors per declaration at h=1, 3, 5).

---

## symbol_freq

A global frequency entry recording how many declarations contain a given symbol, used for inverse-frequency weighting in symbol-based retrieval.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | qualified name | Primary key; must be a fully qualified constant, inductive, or constructor name; must appear in at least one declaration's `symbol_set` |
| `freq` | positive integer | Required; must be > 0; count of declarations containing this symbol |

### Relationships

- **Referenced by** `declarations` via `symbol_set` entries (many-to-many, implicit).

---

## index_meta

A key-value metadata entry managing index lifecycle and version compatibility.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `key` | text | Primary key; must be one of the required keys or a recognized optional key |
| `value` | text | Required; format depends on key (see below) |

### Required keys

| Key | Value constraint |
|-----|-----------------|
| `schema_version` | Parseable as a positive integer; must match the tool's expected version |
| `coq_version` | Valid version string (e.g., `8.19`) |
| `mathcomp_version` | Valid version string, or `null` if MathComp was not indexed |
| `created_at` | Valid ISO 8601 timestamp |

### Relationships

- Standalone entity; no foreign key relationships.

---

## declarations_fts

A full-text search index over declarations enabling lexical search by name, statement, and module.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | text | Content-synced from `declarations.name` |
| `statement` | text | Content-synced from `declarations.statement` |
| `module` | text | Content-synced from `declarations.module` |

Tokenizer: Unicode with Porter stemming. BM25 column weights: name=10.0, statement=1.0, module=5.0.

### Relationships

- **Mirrors** one declaration (1:1, content-synced via `content=declarations, content_rowid=id`; not independently owned).

---

## Cross-Entity Relationships

```
declarations 1──* dependencies (owns, as src)
declarations 1──* dependencies (owns, as dst)
declarations 1──3 wl_vectors (owns, one per h value)
declarations *──* symbol_freq (references, via symbol_set)
declarations 1──1 declarations_fts (mirrors, content-synced)
index_meta (standalone)
```

## Schema Versioning

The index is a derived artifact — it is always rebuildable from source `.vo` files. There is no incremental migration. When the schema version changes, the entire index is rebuilt from scratch. The `schema_version` key in `index_meta` is the sole mechanism for detecting incompatibility.
