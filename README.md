# Poule à Coq

*"Un coq a bien besoin d'une poule."
(A rooster really needs a hen.)*

Poule ("Hen") supports the Coq ("Rooster") procedural logic community.

Semantic lemma search, interactive proof exploration, and proof visualization for Coq/Rocq libraries — delivered as an MCP server for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

Poule indexes compiled Coq `.vo` libraries into a SQLite database and provides multi-channel retrieval (structural, symbol, lexical, neural, type-based) with reciprocal rank fusion. It also supports interactive proof sessions and Mermaid-based visualization of proof states, proof trees, and dependency graphs.

## Features

### Search

- **Structural** — Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, tree edit distance, and collapse matching
- **Symbol** — MePo-style iterative relevance filtering with weighted symbol overlap
- **Lexical** — FTS5 full-text search over names, statements, and modules
- **Neural** — bi-encoder embeddings (INT8, CPU-only) fused with symbolic channels via RRF
- **Type** — multi-channel fusion combining all of the above
- **Dependency navigation** — `uses`, `used_by`, `same_module`, `same_typeclass`

### Neural Premise Selection

- Train a bi-encoder on proof traces with masked contrastive loss and hard negative mining
- Evaluate with Recall@k and MRR; compare neural vs. symbolic retrieval
- Fine-tune on project-specific proofs; export to INT8 ONNX for <10ms CPU inference
- Graceful degradation — search works identically without a model checkpoint

### Proof Interaction

- Open interactive proof sessions against `.v` files
- Observe proof states, submit tactics, step forward/backward
- Extract full proof traces with per-step premise annotations
- Batch tactic submission and concurrent sessions

### Visualization

- Proof state, proof tree, dependency subgraph, and step-by-step sequence diagrams
- Generated as Mermaid syntax, rendered via the [Mermaid Chart MCP](https://github.com/Mermaid-Chart/mermaid-mcp-server)

## Quick Start

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/).

**1. Get the launcher script**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekirton/poule.git
cp poule/poule ~/bin/poule
chmod +x ~/bin/poule
```

**2. Add to your `~/.zshrc`**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          # your Anthropic API key
export POULE_PROJECT_DIR=~/Projects/my-coq-project   # your Coq project
```

Make sure `~/bin` is on your `PATH` (add `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"` if needed).

**3. Run**

```bash
poule          # drops you into a shell inside the container
claude         # then start Claude Code
```

Everything runs inside the container — no local Coq, Python, or opam installation required. On first run, the launcher pulls the image, initializes a persistent home directory at `~/poule-home`, and downloads the Coq search index automatically.

If you want to use a different project for a one-off session, just `cd` into it and run `poule` — the launcher falls back to `$PWD` when `POULE_PROJECT_DIR` is not set.

### Persistent home directory

State is preserved across sessions in `~/poule-home`:

```
~/poule-home/
├── .claude/          # Claude Code settings, MCP config, auth
├── .ssh/             # SSH keys (copy yours here if needed)
├── .gitconfig        # Git configuration
├── .zsh_history      # Shell history
└── data/
    └── index.db      # Coq search index
```

To set up git and SSH inside the container, copy your existing config:

```bash
cp ~/.gitconfig ~/poule-home/.gitconfig
cp -r ~/.ssh ~/poule-home/.ssh
```

### Updating

The launcher pulls the latest image each time it runs. To skip the pull:

```bash
poule --no-pull
```

To download a newer search index:

```bash
rm ~/poule-home/data/index.db
poule    # re-download triggers automatically
```

## Use with Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is Anthropic's agentic coding tool — you interact with it in natural language from your terminal. Poule extends Claude's capabilities through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/): when you ask Claude a question about Coq, it automatically calls the right Poule tools behind the scenes and presents the results in plain language. You never need to invoke Poule tools directly.

For example, you can ask Claude things like:

**Search:**
- *"Find lemmas about list reversal being involutive"*
- *"Search for lemmas with type `forall n : nat, n + 0 = n`"*
- *"What's in the Coq.Arith module?"*

**Proof interaction:**
- *"Open a proof session on `rev_involutive` in `examples/lists.v` and show me the current goal"*
- *"Step through the proof of `add_comm` in `examples/arith.v` and explain each tactic"*
- *"Try applying `intros` then `induction n` in my current proof session"*

**Dependencies:**
- *"What lemmas does `Nat.add_comm` depend on?"*
- *"Which lemmas use `Nat.add_0_r`?"*
- *"Show me other lemmas in the same module as `List.rev_append`"*

**Visualization:**
- *"Visualize the proof tree for `app_nil_r` in `examples/lists.v`"*
- *"Show me the dependency graph around `Nat.add_comm`"*
- *"Render the step-by-step proof evolution of `modus_ponens` in `examples/logic.v`"*

Claude will search the index, manage proof sessions, and generate diagrams on your behalf.

**Skills (slash commands):**

Poule also provides compound workflows that orchestrate multiple tools in a single command:

- *`/formalize For all natural numbers, addition is commutative`* — Claude searches for existing lemmas, proposes a formal Coq statement, type-checks it, and helps build the proof interactively
- *`/explain-proof Nat.add_comm`* — step through a proof with plain-language explanations of each tactic, including mathematical intuition
- *`/compress-proof rev_involutive in src/Lists.v`* — find shorter proof alternatives, verify each one, present ranked options
- *`/proof-obligations`* — scan your project for `admit`/`Admitted`/`Axiom`, classify intent, rank by severity
- *`/proof-repair`* — after a Coq version upgrade, systematically fix broken proofs through a build→fix→rebuild loop
- *`/proof-lint src/Core.v`* — detect deprecated tactics, inconsistent bullets, and complex tactic chains; optionally auto-fix
- *`/explain-error`* — parse a Coq type error, fetch relevant definitions, explain the root cause in plain language with fix suggestions
- *`/migrate-rocq`* — bulk-rename deprecated `Coq.*` namespaces to `Rocq.*` with build verification
- *`/check-compat`* — check dependency compatibility before you hit opaque build failures
- *`/scaffold`* — generate a complete project skeleton (Dune, opam, CI, boilerplate)
