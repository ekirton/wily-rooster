### Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern | Owns | Architecture Doc |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Coq Expression Normalization | Tree normalization pipeline, CSE reduction | [coq-normalization.md](coq-normalization.md) |
| Proof Serialization | JSON serialization of proof types, schema versioning, determinism, diff computation | [proof-serialization.md](proof-serialization.md) |
| Extraction Output Format | JSON Lines serialization of extraction records, provenance metadata, record type discrimination | [extraction-output.md](extraction-output.md) |
| Extraction Checkpointing | Incremental re-extraction, campaign resumption, checkpoint file management (P1) | [extraction-checkpointing.md](extraction-checkpointing.md) |
| Extraction Reporting | Quality reports, scope filtering, benchmark generation, ML export (P1/P2) | [extraction-reporting.md](extraction-reporting.md) |
| Extraction Dependency Graph | Theorem-level dependency graph extraction from premise annotations (P1) | [extraction-dependency-graph.md](extraction-dependency-graph.md) |
| Neural Retrieval Channel | Neural embedding computation, vector search, integration into retrieval pipeline | [neural-retrieval.md](neural-retrieval.md) |

Proof Serialization is used by the MCP Server (for formatting responses) and the Proof Session Manager (for trace export). It is not a standalone runtime component — it is a shared serialization contract.

Extraction Output Format extends Proof Serialization concepts to the batch extraction context. It defines the JSON Lines stream structure, record type discrimination, and provenance metadata. It is used by the Extraction Campaign Orchestrator.

Coq Backend Processes (one per session) are owned by the Proof Session Manager. They appear as a separate box in the dependency graph because they are separate OS processes, but they are not an independent component — their lifecycle is fully managed by the session manager.

```

Note: The four subsystems — search, proof interaction, extraction, and proof search — have distinct dependency patterns. Search and proof interaction are independent of each other. Extraction depends on the Proof Session Manager but not search. Proof search is the first component that bridges search and proof interaction at runtime: it uses the Proof Session Manager for tactic verification and optionally uses the Retrieval Pipeline for premise retrieval. The Fill Admits Orchestrator depends on both the Proof Search Engine and the Proof Session Manager. The Mermaid Renderer is a pure function component with no runtime dependencies.

The Neural Training Pipeline is a batch-mode component invoked via CLI. It reads extracted training data (JSON Lines from Phase 3) and the SQLite index (for premise corpus), and produces model checkpoints. The Neural Retrieval Channel is a cross-cutting concern: at indexing time it computes embeddings (extending Coq Library Extraction → Storage); at query time it provides a retrieval channel (extending the Retrieval Pipeline). Both are optional — all other components function without them.
