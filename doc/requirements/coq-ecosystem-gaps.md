# Coq/Rocq Ecosystem — Opportunity Landscape

## 1. Ecosystem Overview

The Coq/Rocq ecosystem has several unmet needs that hinder adoption and productivity. The Lean ecosystem has surged ahead with purpose-built tooling for search, proof interaction, and AI integration. Coq's tooling gaps span discoverability, proof interaction, training data extraction, and developer experience. This document captures the full opportunity set; per-initiative PRDs contain detailed requirements.
