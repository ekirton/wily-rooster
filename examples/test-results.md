# Example Prompt Test Results

## Examples are End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The examples of user prompts are used as end-to-end tests.  They are not executed via GitHub workflows because they require an Anthropic API key and due to cost, they should not be run automatically for each PR.

Tested: 2026-03-21 (retest of 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 after suffix expansion and query-time type normalization fixes)

## Instructions for Claude

* When an issue is resolved, do not mark it as "FIXED", simply delete it from the list.
* After rerunning tests, update the "Tested:" line above with the current date and the extent of the retest (e.g. if not all tests, give a very brief description of how tests were selected)
* Summarize issues (bugs/gaps) in lists at the bottom with sufficient detail for them to be investigated further.
* Test only Poule-MCP prompts; skip skills and those requiring example project data.

## Limitations of automated testing

Currently tests are limited to Poule-MCP and exclude those which require a user project or are a slash command (complex skill).

## Results

Each prompt from `README.md` was executed against the Poule MCP tools and evaluated:
- **PASS** — tool returned relevant, non-empty results that answer the question
- **FAIL** — tool returned an error, empty results, or clearly unrelated results
- **SKIP** — prompt requires context that doesn't exist (active proof session, user-specific files, or is a slash command)

**Summary: 51 PASS, 3 FAIL, 35 SKIP (89 total)**

## Remaining Issues

### search_by_type misses higher-order queries (1.4)
- `search_by_type` for the `List.map` composition lemma returned 50 results but none matched `List.map_map`
- **Query normalization (fixed)**: `search_by_type` now resolves short constant names to FQNs, detects free variables (`f`, `g`, `l`) and wraps them in forall binders converting `Const` nodes to `Rel`, and uses a relaxed WL size filter (2.0 vs 1.2). This enables structural and symbol channels to match queries written as type patterns against fully-quantified indexed types.
- **Blocking issue — incomplete index data**: `Coq.Lists.List.map_map` has `node_count=1`, no `constr_tree`, no WL histogram, and empty `symbol_set` in the index. 45% of declarations (37K of 82K) lack structural data. No amount of query normalization can surface a declaration with no structural or symbol data — only FTS can reach it. This is the primary reason the test still fails.
- **Remaining gap — FQN display name mismatch**: the user writes `List.map` but the index stores the canonical definition FQN `ListDef.map` (Coq re-exports `ListDef.map` as `List.map`). The suffix index has `map` but not `List.map`, so FQN resolution fails for this specific name.
- **Remaining gap — binder type approximation**: forall-wrapped free variables receive `Sort("Type")` as binder type, while indexed types have concrete binder types (e.g., `A -> B`, `list A`). The outer quantifier nodes score lower on structural matching, but the body — the majority of both trees — matches well.
- **Pending E2E verification**: unit tests pass; MCP server restart required to verify the normalization fix against declarations that do have structural data.

### impact_analysis returns empty graphs (3.4, 3.5)
- `impact_analysis` returns only root node with 0 edges for stdlib lemmas (`Nat.add_comm`, `Nat.add_0_r`) even with fully qualified names — reverse dependency edges not populated
